A simple yet an amazing game to play with your friends and family. Playing cricket is fun, but what if you don't have the equipment? What if you want to play a sweet little game in any given moment? You've come to the right place

*This project has made in java*
## Rules
* First choose bat or bowl to play
* Let's say you have chosen batting. Now you have to type the number between 1-6 to score. If you type more than 6 then it will be considered as OUT. Let's say computer threw a 6 and you threw a 4, then you get 4 runs(the number of the bowler is just simply "let go" for now). If your number and computer number is same then that also considered as OUT.
* After batting you have to bowl. You have to match the number of batsman(computer) to OUT.
* Final score will be calculated after the match and winner's name will be decleared. Get it? It's thaaaat simple.

#### NB: *0 is not invalid run here. You might notice sometime computer throws 0 that means nothing but it is dodging your ball*
